Currently, Breathing and living with Cloud computing ( AWS ), Terraform 0.12, 0.13, 0.15, 0.1.14, HCL, EKS, Kubernetes, Helm ( write helm charts ), ArgoCD, AWS CodeBuild/CodePipeline/CodeDeploy, tfscaffold, ECS, Fargate,Private link, RDS, S3, VPC, Route53, VPN, Transit Gateway, lambda, Serverless etc., setup dynatrace and monitoring, python, Dockers, /bin/bash :P. enjoys the work and setting up boundaries for stack holders, managing releases. Interact and co-ordinate with clients on setting up communication links like SSL and VPN. Automation on Boto3, etc., Managed and moved manually deployment of several application services to code pipeline. Design & build infra, CI/ CD pipelines on AWS using IAC ( terraform ), Design & build kubernetes clusters ( EKS ), Design & build automation systems ( Pythons, bash, boto3) Guide Administrators and devops engineers

Previous to the above, Teamcity, uDeploy / urban deploy, openshift, Python, shellscript ( bash and ksh ) devOps, CI/CD, provisioning, Git, Github, Gitlab, Stash / Bitbucket and managing server configurations.

prior to this, was I was as developer on JVM based application ( Java / Scala ) for 10+ years.

Programming/Development HCL, Low latency application, Cluster computing, Concurrency, Parallel processing, Scala, Akka, Spray, Akka HTTP, Slick, REST, Postgres, Docker, Linux, Apache Kafka, Core Java, Sprint-boot, H2DB etc., rust-lang, Streaming( Akka, Quickfix-j, kafka)

Well to say cargo.codehaus during (2007 ) was the precursor for my interest on moving to automated deployment, later got introduced to hudson ( 2010 ) which is now named as Jenkins ( because of Oracle took over Java ).

Object Oriented Programming, Functional Programming concepts and design patterns.

Exploring "distributed cloud, kubernetes" and Curious to explore and help to modernize infra.
