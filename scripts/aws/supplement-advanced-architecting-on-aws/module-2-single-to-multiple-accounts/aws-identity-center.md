# AWS  IDENTITY CENTER

**Note:** AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) is now [AWS IAM Identity Center](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/scale-your-workforce-access-management-with-aws-iam-identity-center-previously-known-as-aws-sso/). Amazon Web Services (AWS) is changing the name to highlight the serviceâ€™s foundation in AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM), to better reflect its full set of capabilities, and to reinforce its recommended role as the central place to manage access across AWS accounts and applications.&#x20;
